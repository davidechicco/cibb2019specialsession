<h3>Call for papers</h3>
<p>
This is the webpage for the call for papers for the special session <strong>Machine Learning in Healthcare Informatics and Medical Biology</strong> within the <a href="https://dinamico2.unibg.it/cazzaniga/cibb2019/index.html">16th International Conference on Computational Intelligence methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (CIBB 2019)</a> that will be held at Università di Bergamo, Bergamo, Italy, EU.
<p>
If you are working on a project related to the topics described below, you are warmly invited to submit a short paper to our special session.


<h3>Aim and scope</h3>
<p>
Machine learning has become a pivotal tool to analyze biomedical and biological datasets, especially in the Big Data era. In fact, machine learning algorithms can identify hidden relationships and structures in health care data, and even take advantage of them to make accurate predictions about similar or future data instances. For example, machine learning software has been able to predict the diagnosis of tumor patients just by processing patients' clinical features, allowing scientists to save time and money compared to wet lab experiments. Computational researchers have also exploited machine learning to infer knowledge about patients by analyzing biological datasets, especially the ones featuring genetics and epigenomic traits. Data mining approaches applied to such datasets, in fact, can lead to relevant discoveries both to understand molecular biology and to gain new knowledge about patients’ diseases. 
<p>
Our special session on "Machine Learning in Healthcare Informatics and Medical Biology" aims at boosting these scientific fields, calling for researchers able to show the potential and the advance of machine learning algorithms to make accurate computational predictions in health care datasets and in patient-oriented biological datasets. 
<p>
Topics of interest include:

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
  <li> Machine learning methods applied to health care and biomedical datasets </li>
<li> Machine learning methods applied to genetics and epigenomics datasets, to understand the conditions of healthy and/or sick patients  </li>
<li> Machine learning methods applied to biological datasets to understand the underlying biomolecular scenario  </li>
<li> Machine learning software and tools in the health care and biological domain  </li>
<li> Statistical models to analyze health care, biomedical, and biological datasets  </li>
<li> Data mining applications in the health care and biological domain  </li>
</ul>

<h3>The CIBB conference series </h3>
<p>
The International Conference on Computational Intelligence methods for Bioinformatics and Biostatistics (CIBB) is an annual scientific conference dedicated to computational intelligence algorithms applied to bioinformatics and biostatistics problems. It started in Perugia (Italy,  EU) in 2004 and CIBB 2019 will be the 16th edition. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Conference_on_Computational_Intelligence_Methods_for_Bioinformatics_and_Biostatistics">You can read more about CIBB on Wikipedia</a>.

<h3>The journey of the special session papers: from conference submission to journal publication</h3>
<p>
One of the goal of this special session is to drive authors to improve the quality of their papers, and make them suitable for journal publication. By taking advantage of all the steps of the submission process and of the presence at the conference, the authors can keep improving their manuscript until the final publication on the journal.</br>
A schematic idea of the process:</br>
<ul>
<li>The authors submit their short paper to the special session (paper version 1.0)</li>
<li>The authors address the comments of the special session peer reviewers, and submit a new version (paper version 2.0). This paper version will be informally distributed at the conference, but will not be an official publication (it will have no ISBN or DOI code).</li>
<li>If the paper is accepted, the authors present it at the conference, and collect the in-person questions and comments of the audience to prepare a new version (paper version 3.0)</li>
<li>If the authors are interested in publishing an extended version of their paper in the journal supplement, they extend the short paper presented at the conference, and submit it to the journal (paper version 4.0)</li>
<li>The authors receive the comments of the journal editor and reviewers, addressed them, and submit a new version to the journal (paper version 5.0)</li>
<li>If accepted, the paper is published in the journal supplement (paper version 6.0 -- final)</li>
</ul>
